# HybridCamera
A plugin for Dalamud with FFXIV which lets you slightly customize the movement/camera mode.

At the moment, this just lets you configure keys which switch the control scheme to legacy when pressed, and back to standard when unpressed. I would like to add mouse input (for example, forcing standard mode on lmb), but have not found a clean way to do this.
